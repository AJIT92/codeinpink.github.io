    My website containing info about me, my projects, and my blog. I've wanted a site
    like this for a long time, but it's been put off due to school, work, other projects,
    and laziness. After I finished my last project, I forced myself to work on and
    finish this so that I could finally have an online CV-like website. The picture
    and name should look familiar since this project is the site you're currently using!

    This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and is built using Jekyll, an awesome static site
    generator. I wrote a few custom plugins to generate category and tag pages for my blog
    and project pages out of my project data files. The site also offers searching and
    a usable contact form despite being static (thanks to Tipue Search and Formspree,
    respectively).

    I love this site, and I'm so glad that it's finally done! One of the great things
    about taking a break and returning to a project is understanding everything
    better the second time around, and I can definitely say that's the case here.
    I forced myself to *really* understand the docs this time, and I've learned
    so much since the last time I worked on this project that things like
    templates, filters, paths, plugins, and even Ruby make more sense.

    I really love static site generators now, too! It's really fun figuring out
    how to have certain functionality without a database or access to a server.
