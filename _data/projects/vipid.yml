    A hybrid mobile application that's like a digital rolodex of information that never goes out-of-date.  We aim to be the
    LinkedIn of business cards.

    Instead of handing someone your business card, you can scan each other's QR codes (like Snapchat), use NFC, or use some other method
    to exchange contact information.  You can select *what* information you want to share based on the person you are connecting with,
    whether that includes a portfolio and LinkedIn profile for a recruiter or a Facebook and Twitter for someone you just met.  You
    can then add the contact to a group (like "DjangoCon 2017") or add tags, where you met the person, and other information that will
    help you remember the connection.  Resume sharing, meeting requests, and other cool features are planned.

    This was exclusively built by me (with a few memes tossed in by my friend Jose).
    This took at least 500 hours from my rough time estimates, and the last two months before launch were
    full of 8-12 hour days on top of school.

    The app itself is built using Ionic2, a framework on top of Cordova (which lets you build web applications natively).
    Ionic2 uses Angular2, and Angular2 suggests Typescript, so I used that, as well.  The server is Django, a Python framework,
    and is used mostly for the database models and the API (built using Django Rest Framework).  The server is currently hosted
    on Heroku because I really hate configuring servers and heroku is **freaking awesome**.
reflection: |
    Ionic is awesome -- **seriously**.  Lots of apps are simple enough that a web app works, and I don't think the user would know
    the difference as long as it is styled like an app should be (which Ionic makes **incredibly easy**).  I love that if you need to use
    native functions there is support for that, and that functionality makes building hybrid apps like this way more exciting than a typical
    web application.

    I also love Django, but that's nothing new.  ;)
