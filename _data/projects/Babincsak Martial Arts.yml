    A website for my family's business, Babincsak Martial Arts. I designed and built this site, and I was responsible for
    90% of the site's content. The site, along with the facebook page, is now a major part in new student sign-ups.

    My father founded Babincsak Martial Arts in the fall of 2013, and since I had the power to contribute to my family's wellness,
    I wanted our business to be one of the 50% of businesses that survive past their first five years. A website for the business
    is a crucial part of securing that goal.

    With this in mind, I taught myself HTML and CSS through tutorials and inspecting elements/viewing page sources of sites around
    the web. I slowly built the site, and I finished it during my winter break. It was *okay*. It was definitely better than most sites by
    beginners, but I wasn't proud of it enough to show it off without explaining that I was new to making web sites and that I wasn't
    a designer. To be truly happy, I needed to redo it.

    So I did, and this time, I learned Bootstrap. This not only helped with the design of the site but also helped with the
    responsive and mobile aspects of it, too, both of which were non-existent in the previous version. I made sure the site looked good
    on all screen sizes, and then I started looking into the little things like improving site load times and SEO, again - both of which
    were non-existent in the previous version. I'm happy to say that the site quickly increased in page rank due to my efforts, and now
    it sits comfortably at the top for its relevent search terms.

reflection: |
    When I initially built the site, it was very basic, and because I didn't know much, it looked very basic, too. I'm glad I
    went back and rebuilt it because not only does it look **much** better now, but it also taught me a lot, too. I learned about
    responsive design and making a site mobile-friendly, both of which have contributed to decisions in future work/projects. I
    now also consider things like site load times (and its corresponding techniques to lower it) and SEO when building sites.

    The site isn't without fault, though, and there are a few things I would change:

    *   Use absolute paths (seriously ashamed of both not understanding and not using them)
    *   Use a static site generator which would help clean up the includes, the gallery,
        recent pictures, etc.
