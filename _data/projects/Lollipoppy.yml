    If I had to pick a project that represents my personality, this would be the one!

    The game uses cute candy art to create an adorable "Candy Wonderland" type world.  You start collecting
    candy as the time (represented by your life) counts down, enjoying Willy Wonka's
    "Oompa Loompa" as you do, until suddenly the music changes.  Some creepy music
    is now playing in your earphones...

    More to come.  :)
