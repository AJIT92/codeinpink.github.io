    A website that I designed and built for Putnam County's Sheriff's Office as an intern.
    Since the site would need to be updated frequently for pictures, news and events, etc.,
    Wordpress seemed like the ideal solution. I learned Wordpress and used HTML, CSS, PHP,
    and Bootstrap to make the site.

    This site, due to its size and the enourmous amount of media and content required, took
    much longer than the duration of my internship to finish, and I agreed to continue working
    on it past my internship. I volunteered to make changes when needed for around
    four and a half months.

    Building this site gave me insight into how to work with customers (the Sheriff's Office being
    my "customer" in this experience). First, communication is key, especially in regard to deadlines
    and expectations. Second, there will be compromise. Sometimes, you will need to compromise on some aspect
    to make the customer happy, whether this is a design element or something bigger.
    Furthermore, there *will* be times when you will strongly disagree with something,
    and it's important to stay diplomatic and *explain* your viewpoint. This is even more crucial when it's
    something that you know would be wrong or detrimental.
reflection: |
    I'm proud of the design of the site; I had to compromise in some areas, but
    overall I think the site looks professional and modern-enough while also giving
    off a "Sheriff's Office" vibe.

    If I could change some things, I would definitely make the site more Wordpress-friendly.
    I have more experience (and time) now that I could make a lot more
    elements of the site be easily editable through the Wordpress interface; some things
    are unfortunately hidden away in the theme files which makes it hard for others
    to change.

    I would also be more vocal in regard to expectations, responsibilities, and other people.
    I might have been too nice when I continued to work on the site past the
    end of my internship, especially when I was already working 40 hours a week
    as part of my co-op and things kept being changed with no end
    in sight. There were also more than a few times when the site was held up
    because of something taking a week (or two!) when it should have taken 5 minutes,
    and I think if I explained my concerns to someone, then maybe that would have been
    taken care of.
