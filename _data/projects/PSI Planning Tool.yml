    A web application for PSI planning. Import a list of teams and a list of features,
    and each team can then add commitments to the features they've been assigned,
    features belonging to other teams, or new features they add themselves.
    Teams can then add risks and dependencies for each commitment, and when they
    are done adding commitments, they can set their PSI capacity. People can view
    all the data being added on the All page which automatically refreshes data.

    It originally started as a hackathon project, but I continued working on it so
    that it could be used a week and a half later for the next PSI planning! I was
    one of two people who worked on it, and I wrote all of the back end code and
    most of the front end. For the back end, I used Django so that I could get even
    more experience with the framework. On the front end, we used Angular since there
    would be a lot of data being sent back and forth, so using a two-way data binding,
    MVC framework was definitely the right decision.

    This was so fun! I got more experience with Django, learned and got **a lot**
    of experience with Angular, and built something that the company actually used
    a week and a half later! In the end, 57 out of 66 teams imported used it compared
    to its alternative, so I think it's safe to say people enjoyed it.

    Things I learned:

    - Django REST Framework is **awesome**. It's crazy to think that in
    my last (and first) Django project I wrote *all* the API endpoints myself, and
    only *some* were RESTful. This will definitely be a staple in any future
    Django projects.
    - Angular is *also* **awesome**. Up until this project, I only ever used jQuery
    for CRUD operations, and when you have a lot of models, the code adds up.
    Angular makes *everything* so simple once you understand it, and I'm really eager
    to use more Angular as well as try out other MVC front end frameworks!
