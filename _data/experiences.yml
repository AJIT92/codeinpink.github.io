    I developed a website for Putnam County's Sheriff's Office that would allow them
    to effectively and efficiently 1) communicate with the public and 2) share information
    with the community.  This was my first time using Wordpress, and I also provided
    a custom design for the website.

  summary: |
    I developed features for one of ADTRAN's internal sites using Python, Bottle,
    and MongoDB for the back end and HTML, CSS, LESS, and JavaScript (+ jQuery and
    other libraries) for the front end. This term was **so much fun** because I
    learned **A LOT** about web development, Python, testing, etc., and
    everything I worked on was useful -- no throwaway code!
