    I developed a website for Putnam County's Sheriff's Office that would allow them
    to effectively and efficiently 1) communicate with the public and 2) share information
    with the community.  This was my first time using Wordpress, and I also provided
    a custom design for the website.

  summary: |
    I developed features for one of ADTRAN's internal sites using Python, Bottle,
    and MongoDB for the back end and HTML, CSS, LESS, and JavaScript (+ jQuery and
    other libraries) for the front end. This term was **so much fun** because I
    learned **A LOT** about web development, Python, testing, etc., and
    everything I worked on was useful -- no throwaway code!

    I worked on a variety of things this term! My work ranged from developing a plugin
    in Wordpress using PHP and JavaScript, to working on cross browser compatibility,
    developing a fully functional PSI planning web app using Django and Angular, and
    working on the UI for a next generation network management platform.

    Essentially back on my last team, I once again worked on the UI for our next generation
    network management platform using Angular and JavaScript!  This term I got more exposure
    to other projects and components, and I even got to work a little with some Python!  Overall,
    I felt like a normal, full-time member of the team.
